## üìå Project Overview  
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women, and early detection plays a critical role in improving survival rates. Radiologists rely heavily on mammograms to detect abnormalities such as **breast masses** and **micro-calcifications**. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming, subject to fatigue, and prone to inter-observer variability.  

This project introduces a **multi-view deep learning framework** for the **pre-processing, segmentation, and classification** of mammograms into **BI-RADS categories**. The system integrates advanced enhancement pipelines, dual-path segmentation using **Modified Hybrid Transformer U-Net (HTU-Net)** and **U-Net**, and final classification with **EfficientNetB3 + ANN**. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy and robustness, with potential integration into **Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems**.

## üß© Methodology  

### 1. Pre-processing  
Pre-processing ensures **image standardization, enhancement, and ROI clarity**, preparing data for segmentation and classification.  

- **Dataset**: INBreast dataset (high-resolution DICOM mammograms with annotations).  
- **View Handling**: Cranio-Caudal (CC) and Mediolateral Oblique (MLO) views.  
- **Pectoral Muscle Removal**: Eliminated in MLO views to prevent misdiagnosis.  
![Pectoral_Muscle_Removal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1taYXipFDwTgFXXrjTY0pAWjZvnofWfFw/view?usp=sharing)
- **Standardization**:  
  - Cropping breast tissue using largest external contour detection.  
  - Proportional resizing to **1024√ó1024 pixels**, preserving anatomical integrity.  
  - Zero-intensity padding to avoid distortions.  
![Standardization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dKJihOHzCAYKL6Z4bEg1WF5DExiLHPP6/view?usp=sharing)

#### Mass Enhancement Pipeline  
- Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (**CLAHE**).  
- Global thresholding to highlight suspicious ROIs.  
- Magma color mapping.  
- Channel decomposition & fusion (R-G, R-B, B-G).  
- **B-G fusion** achieved the best performance (CNR, SSIM, Colorfulness).

#### Calcification Enhancement Pipeline  
- High-pass filtering (Gaussian low-pass subtraction).  
- Rectification + Gaussian smoothing to improve SNR.  
- Adaptive thresholding to isolate calcifications.  
- Overlaying binary mask on mammogram for improved visualization.  
![Calcification_Enhancement_Pipeline2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AJCiQBjBvZPK0UYmExgLvWrVF1qnn6Pf/view?usp=sharing)

‚úÖ *Results:* Up to **72% improvement in CNR for masses** and **46% improvement in PSNR for calcifications** compared to conventional methods.

### 2. Segmentation  
A **dual-path segmentation framework** was developed to handle differences between **masses** (irregular, diffuse) and **calcifications** (tiny, high-intensity).  

#### Dual-Path Framework  
- **Mass segmentation** ‚Üí Modified **HTU-Net**  
- **Calcification segmentation** ‚Üí Standard **U-Net with patch-based reconstruction**  
- **Fusion** ‚Üí Overlay of results with distinct colors for clarity.  



#### Mass Segmentation (Modified HTU-Net)  
- Encoder-decoder structure enhanced with **Spatial-Channel Enhanced Self Attention (SCESA)**.  
- Multi-Head Attention (MHA) at bottleneck for global dependencies.  
- Conv2D positional encodings instead of patch embeddings.  
- **Performance**: DSC = **0.6064**, Precision = **0.5988**.

#### Calcification Segmentation (U-Net + Patch-based Method)  
- 64√ó64 patches (stride 32), reconstructed with cosine Hanning window merging.  
- Encoder: 3 convolutional blocks; Bottleneck: 512 filters; Decoder: 3 upsampling blocks.  
- **Performance**: DSC = **0.8022**, Precision = **0.8958**.

#### Post-processing  
- Thresholding ‚Üí Binary mask.  
- Morphological closing ‚Üí Smooth boundaries, remove noise.  
- Largest connected component retained (for masses).  
- Boundary refinement for calcifications by multiplying masks with normalized pre-processed images.  
- Final overlay of masses + calcifications.

### 3. Classification  
After segmentation, ROIs are classified into **BI-RADS categories (2‚Äì5)**.  

#### Models Evaluated  
- **Single View CNN** (baseline).  
- **Multi-View CNN** (parallel CC + MLO pathways).  
- **EfficientNetB3 + ANN (Proposed)**:  
  - Pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned with mammograms.  
  - Global average pooling + feature concatenation across both views.  
  - Dense ANN layers as classifier.  
  - Optimizer: Adam, LR = 0.0005, with 5-fold cross-validation.

#### Class Imbalance Handling  
- Enhanced **SMOTE with adaptive k-neighbors** to balance BI-RADS categories.
